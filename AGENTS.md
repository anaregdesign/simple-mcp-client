# Commit Messages

- Write commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/
- Use this format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
- Common `type` examples: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

# Skill Prerequisite

- Before starting development, install the project skill with Codex standard setup by placing it under `$CODEX_HOME/skills/`.
- If `CODEX_HOME` is not set, set it first (example: `export CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex"`).
- Recommended setup command:
  - `export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}" && npm run skill:enable`
- Restart Codex (or start a new session) after installing/updating the skill.

# Implementation Policy

## Development Phase Rule

- Current phase is active development.
- Do not add backward compatibility shims or fallback behavior unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer clean replacement of old contracts over dual-path support.

## Domain Vocabulary and Naming Source of Truth

- Treat Prisma schema entity/table/field names as the canonical domain vocabulary.
- Use the same term for the same entity across:
  - Prisma schema
  - server/client TypeScript identifiers
  - API route names and payload keys
  - component names and UI labels when practical
  - tests, mocks, fixtures, and documentation
- Do not keep parallel aliases for a single entity (for example, `Message` vs `Dialogue`).
- When naming drift is found, rename code to Prisma vocabulary rather than introducing adapters.
- In development phase, remove legacy names directly instead of keeping compatibility aliases.
- When terminology is updated, apply the rename end-to-end in one pass (schema references, code identifiers, API contracts, UI text, tests, docs) to avoid mixed vocabulary states.

## Data Modeling and Normalization

- Prefer normalized relational structures over JSON blobs when data has stable entity boundaries.
- Introduce and use master tables for reusable entities (for example, Workspace-level skill and registry masters).
- Reference master entities from thread/message linkage tables instead of duplicating denormalized payloads.
- Keep per-user persisted resources user-scoped by default (DB ownership and storage directory partitioning).
- For log-like entities, persist explicit timestamps and preserve insertion order semantics.

## Prisma Schema and MCP Debug Metadata Sync

- When `prisma/schema.prisma` changes for persisted models/fields, update `/mcp/debug` schema design descriptions in `app/lib/server/persistence/mcp-debug-database.ts` in the same implementation pass.
- Keep `/mcp/debug` metadata aligned end-to-end:
  - metadata definition rows (role/field/type/nullability entries)
  - latest-thread description schema-source model list (`buildDatabaseDebugLatestThreadToolDescription`)
  - any affected MCP debug tool descriptions generated from metadata
- Verify sync with `app/lib/server/persistence/mcp-debug-database.test.ts`.
- After Prisma schema updates that affect persisted models/fields, run:
  - `npm run test:core -- app/lib/server/persistence/mcp-debug-database.test.ts`
- Keep table metadata definitions modular:
  - `app/lib/server/persistence/mcp-debug-database-metadata.ts` is the source of table metadata rows.
  - `app/lib/server/persistence/mcp-debug-database-types.ts` is the source of metadata types.
  - `app/lib/server/persistence/mcp-debug-database.ts` should consume metadata definitions, not re-inline a large metadata array.
- When metadata definitions change, update metadata module and tests in the same pass.

## Ordering Field Semantics

- Use order field names that encode their purpose, not generic sorting intent.
- Reuse one field name per ordering semantic across entities (same behavior -> same name).
- Use different field names for different ordering semantics (different behavior -> different name).
- Do not overload one field name to represent multiple ordering concepts.
- Prefer names that describe user-facing behavior (timeline order, selection order, configuration order), not implementation detail.

## REST API Contract Standards (`api.*`)

- Design resource-first endpoints:
  - collection routes for list/create
  - item routes for read/update/delete/restore on identified resources
- Use noun-based resource paths; avoid verb-style mutation paths unless the endpoint is an explicit command-style exception.
- Put resource identifiers in path params, not mutation query params.
- Reserve query params for read concerns only (filtering, pagination, sorting, projection).
- Keep `GET` handlers side-effect free (no persistent writes).
- Keep HTTP method semantics and idempotency consistent:
  - `POST`: create or non-idempotent operations
  - `PUT`/`PATCH`: update semantics on identified resources
  - `DELETE`: idempotent delete semantics
- Use status codes consistently:
  - `200` for successful reads/updates with response body
  - `201` with `Location` for resource creation
  - `204` for successful no-content operations
  - `400` malformed request, `401` unauthenticated, `403` unauthorized, `404` not found
  - `405` via `methodNotAllowedResponse` so `Allow` is always present
  - `409` for state conflicts, `422` for validation failures
- Return structured JSON errors with stable machine-readable codes and concise human-readable messages.
- Remove superseded contracts instead of keeping dual API paths unless explicitly requested.

## REST Compliance Gate for `api/*` Changes

- Whenever any `app/routes/api.*` file is modified, explicitly verify REST best-practice compliance before finalizing.
- Required static audit:
  - raw `405` search in `api.*` implementations (must use `methodNotAllowedResponse`)
  - mutation query-contract search (resource IDs passed by query for mutations)
  - status-code audit for `200`/`201`/`204`/`409`/`422` usage consistency
- Required dynamic audit:
  - `npm run test:core -- app/routes/api.*.test.ts`
  - `npm run typecheck:core`

## API Service Boundaries

- Do not import one route module from another in `app/routes/api.*` implementations.
- Shared route logic must live in `app/lib/server/*-service.ts` (or a feature subdirectory under `app/lib/server/`).
- Route modules should own HTTP concerns (method dispatch, status code, response shape, request validation) and delegate reusable domain logic to service modules.
- For any `api.*` refactor, run a static audit that route-to-route import findings are zero.

## Agents SDK Command API Exceptions

- Keep command-style APIs where they are required for Agents SDK runtime behavior:
  - `/api/chat`
  - `/api/instruction-patches`
  - `/api/threads/title-suggestions`
- For these endpoints, prioritize streaming/turn control/context management efficiency over REST purity.
- Document command-style exceptions explicitly when auditing REST compliance.

## Refactor Verification Loop

- Run a static audit after each rename/refactor batch:
  - old term search (`rg`) for deprecated entity names and payload keys
  - raw `405` search in `api.*` implementations
  - old query-contract search (resource IDs passed by query for mutations)
  - route-to-route import search in `app/routes/api.*` implementations
  - duplicated local `*Like` type search in Home UI modules when shared view models were changed
  - duplicated Thread selector pattern search in controller hotspots:
    - `rg -n "threadsRef\\.current\\.find\\(\\(thread\\) => thread\\.id ===" app/lib/home/controller/use-workspace-controller.ts`
  - duplicated Home API auth/error branch search in controller hotspots:
    - `rg -n "resolveAuthRequired\\(response\\.status|!response\\.ok" app/lib/home/controller/use-workspace-controller.ts`
  - `api.chat` helper concentration search:
    - `rg -n "^function " app/routes/api.chat.ts`
- Run dynamic validation after static cleanup:
  - `npm run test:core -- app/routes/api.*.test.ts`
  - `npm run typecheck:core`
  - `npm run quality:gate`
- Repeat static + dynamic audit until new findings are zero.

## Product Identity

- App name is `Local Playground`.
- Keep terminology consistent in UI/docs: `Playground`, `Threads`, `MCP Servers`, `Skills`, `Settings`.
- Keep a desktop-first UX while preserving responsive behavior.

## Layout / UX

- Main layout is two-pane:
  - Left pane: always-visible `Playground` chat area.
  - Right pane: tabbed side panel (`Threads`, `MCP Servers`, `Skills`, `Settings`).
- Keep the vertical splitter between left/right panes resizable.
- Keep right-pane width bounded for desktop usability:
  - right pane minimum: `320px`
  - left pane minimum: `560px`
- On narrow screens (`<= 980px`), switch to stacked layout:
  - top: chat
  - bottom: side panel
  - hide vertical splitter
- Keep `Added MCP Servers` visible in the chat footer as bubble chips under the composer (not in the right pane).
- Keep chat attachment bubbles visible under the composer while drafting.
- Keep thread controls in the Playground header:
  - editable active thread name
  - new thread action
- Use Fluent UI components and patterns as default. Apply custom CSS only where needed for layout clarity, splitter behavior, and compact desktop spacing.

## Frontend Component Architecture

- Keep component boundaries aligned with the real DOM tree.
- For `home` UI, preserve this directory structure:
  - `app/components/home/authorize/` for auth-only top-level panel(s) rendered when sign-in is required
  - `app/components/home/playground/` for left-pane Playground panel and renderers
  - `app/components/home/config/` for right-pane configuration panel
  - `app/components/home/config/threads/` for Threads tab and its sections
  - `app/components/home/config/mcp/` for MCP Servers tab and its sections
  - `app/components/home/config/skills/` for Skills tab and its sections
  - `app/components/home/config/settings/` for Settings tab and its sections
  - `app/components/home/shared/` for reusable UI primitives and shared types
- Naming conventions:
  - `*Panel`: top-level pane container (`UnauthenticatedPanel`, `PlaygroundPanel`, `ConfigPanel`)
  - `*Tab`: tab content root under a panel (`ThreadsTab`, `McpServersTab`, `SkillsTab`, `SettingsTab`)
  - `*Section`: vertically segmented form/content block inside a tab (`InstructionSection`, `ThreadsManageSection`, `SkillsSection`, `McpAddServerSection`)
  - Shared primitives should use purpose-based names (`ConfigSection`, `StatusMessageList`, `AutoDismissStatusMessageList`, `LabeledTooltip`, `CopyIconButton`)
- Place top-level panel components as siblings under `app/components/home/*` according to DOM hierarchy.
  - Do not place one top-level panel inside another panel directory (for example, auth panel under `playground/`).
- Home route modules under `app/routes/` should stay as visual composition only (layout + panel wiring), not runtime state/effects.
- Prefer one-directional dependencies:
  - panel -> tab -> section -> shared
  - avoid cross-importing siblings when a shared primitive is appropriate.

## Home Runtime Structure

- Keep Home runtime state, effects, and API handlers centralized in `app/lib/home/controller/`.
- Do not split primary state ownership across multiple hooks/files unless there is a clear technical need.
- Keep message/MCP renderer helpers outside route modules, under `app/components/home/playground/`.
- Home route modules under `app/routes/` must not re-grow into large logic files; they should compose layout and panel wiring only.
- Prefer extracting pure data transforms into `app/lib/home/*` modules (no React state there).
- Keep per-thread state ownership in the controller:
  - messages
  - active MCP servers
  - thread-scoped execution logs
  - agent instruction
  - thread request status (send/progress/error)
- Keep a single source of truth for active Thread runtime state:
  - canonical state is `threads + activeThreadId`
  - avoid mirrored controller-level state for data already represented in thread snapshots (`messages`, `mcpServers`, `mcpRpcLogs`, `skillSelections`)
- Prefer pure selector/update helpers for Thread snapshot reads and writes under `app/lib/home/thread/*` over ad-hoc duplicated mutation code in controller handlers.
- When `use-workspace-controller.ts` needs Thread lookup by ID, use shared selector helpers (for example `findThreadSnapshotById`) instead of repeating inline `threadsRef.current.find(...)`.
- Use phase-based Thread operation state (`ThreadOperationPhase`) with shared guard helpers instead of many independent busy booleans.
- Apply Thread operation phase updates through transition APIs in `app/lib/home/controller/thread-operation-phase.ts` (for example `transitionThreadOperation` / `canTransition`) instead of direct phase mutation.
- Keep `sendMessage` orchestration thin by delegating precondition checks, request payload composition, stream consumption, and result application to `app/lib/home/controller/send-message-usecase.ts`.
- Centralize shared Home API auth/error handling in `app/lib/home/controller/api-client.ts` (`requestHomeApi`, `resolveAuthRequired`, `mapApiError`) instead of duplicating 401/authRequired/network branches per handler.
- For Home controller fetch calls that read JSON payload and map auth/error branches, use `requestHomeApi` by default and keep per-handler logic limited to domain-specific state updates.
- Keep persistent interactive state in React/controller runtime first.
- Persist controller state to SQLite with delayed writes (debounced/autosave), not eager write-on-every-change.
- Treat SQLite as durable snapshot storage; treat React/controller state as the immediate source of truth during interaction.

## Constants / Imports

- Define shared static constants in constants modules under `app/lib/`.
- Do not add new `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants in feature files unless they are truly file-local and non-shared.
- Import constants directly from the owning constants module under `~/lib/` with the same exported name.
  - Avoid alias renaming (`as`) for constants.
- Avoid re-export-only type/constant passthrough files; import from the source module directly.
- For Home UI and controller boundaries, shared view/domain types belong in `app/lib/home/shared/view-types.ts`.
  - Avoid reintroducing duplicated component-local `*Like` types when the same shape is used in multiple modules.

## Visual Style Baseline (Current UI)

- Theme direction: light Fluent-like desktop UI with compact spacing and flat surfaces.
- Keep root design tokens in `app/app.css` as the style source of truth (font, background, text, accent, danger, bubbles).
- Keep Home-specific shape/typography tokens in `:root` (`--home-*`) and reuse them across components.
- Avoid duplicating hard-coded values for radius/font size/line-height when a token already exists.
- Keep page background as a soft gradient blend (`radial + linear`), not a flat solid color.
- Keep shell surfaces mostly flat:
  - white surfaces
  - minimal/no card shadows
  - tight borders using `--surface-border`
  - square-to-small radii (avoid oversized rounded cards)
- Keep typography stack:
  - UI text: `"Segoe UI", "Yu Gothic UI", "Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN", "Meiryo", sans-serif`
  - code/JSON: `"IBM Plex Mono", "SFMono-Regular", Menlo, monospace`
- Chat styling rules:
  - user messages are right-aligned tinted bubbles (`--bubble-user`)
  - assistant messages stay visually light/flat to prioritize content readability
  - markdown is rendered with compact spacing; JSON is syntax-highlighted
  - keep copy affordances (`⎘`) on messages and MCP logs
- MCP styling rules:
  - MCP Operation Log is inline per turn and collapsed by default (`<details>`)
  - nested MCP entries stay compact, with clear `ok`/`error` state coloring
  - keep request/response JSON blocks readable in constrained height areas
- Tab/side-panel styling rules:
  - use compact subtle tabs with clear selected-state border/background
  - keep setting groups vertically segmented with thin separators
  - preserve compact desktop-first spacing density

## Azure / Auth

- Use `DefaultAzureCredential` for Azure authentication.
- Do not rely on environment variables for Azure project/deployment selection.
- Discover accessible Azure OpenAI projects dynamically from Azure Resource Manager.
- Reload deployments when selected project changes.
- Show only Agents SDK-compatible deployments.
- Use Azure OpenAI v1 endpoint format (`.../openai/v1/`).
- Keep Playground locked while auth is unavailable and guide users to `Settings` login.
- Persist last-used Azure project/deployment per `tenantId` + `principalId`:
  - SQLite database: `local-playground.sqlite`
  - macOS/Linux default location: `~/.foundry_local_playground/local-playground.sqlite`
  - Windows default location: `%APPDATA%\\FoundryLocalPlayground\\local-playground.sqlite`
  - Windows fallback when `APPDATA` is unavailable: `%USERPROFILE%\\.foundry_local_playground\\local-playground.sqlite`

## Agents SDK / Chat Runtime

- Implement chat execution with Agents SDK (`@openai/agents` + `@openai/agents-openai`).
- Keep API error messages concise and in English.
- Preserve IME safety: Enter during composition must not submit.
- Do not expose `temperature` in UI settings; keep it optional at API boundary only.
- Render Markdown responses and apply syntax highlighting to JSON responses.
- Show concrete streaming progress states (not only generic `Thinking...`).
- Support chat attachments for Code Interpreter-compatible files with current validation limits from constants modules under `app/lib/`.
- Keep `app/routes/api.chat.ts` orchestration-focused.
  - Request parsing/metadata handling, SSE response wiring, and reusable runtime helpers should live under `app/lib/server/chat/*`.
- Do not add reusable low-level runtime utilities directly in `app/routes/api.chat.ts` (for example stdio command/path resolution, environment shaping, retry helpers); place them under `app/lib/server/chat/*` with dedicated unit tests.
- On stream disconnect/cancel, propagate `AbortSignal` through chat execution and ensure MCP/session/container cleanup paths always execute.
- Classify stream disconnect as cancellation (not upstream failure): do not emit stream error payload on client disconnect, and log cancellation as info-level (`chat_stream_canceled`).

## Threads / Instruction Behavior

- Keep `Threads` as the default right-pane tab.
- Keep thread switching in `Threads` tab and quick new-thread flow in Playground header.
- Persist each thread snapshot in SQLite with:
  - thread metadata
  - instruction
  - messages
  - connected MCP servers
  - execution logs linked to thread turns
- Save active thread changes from controller logic (debounced/autosave where implemented).
- Agent instruction workflow lives in `Threads` tab and supports:
  - text edit
  - clear
  - load file (`.md`, `.txt`, `.xml`, `.json`, max `1MB`)
  - save on client side using save picker/download flow
  - AI enhancement using currently selected Azure project/deployment
  - diff review (adopt enhanced vs keep original)
- Skill discovery roots for the app runtime:
  - CODEX_HOME shared skills: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/`
  - app-data shared skills: `<foundry-config-dir>/skills/` (same parent directory as `local-playground.sqlite`)

## MCP Server Management

- Support transports: `streamable_http`, `sse`, `stdio`.
- Persist saved MCP profiles:
  - SQLite database: `local-playground.sqlite`
  - macOS/Linux default location: `~/.foundry_local_playground/local-playground.sqlite`
  - Windows default location: `%APPDATA%\\FoundryLocalPlayground\\local-playground.sqlite`
  - Windows fallback when `APPDATA` is unavailable: `%USERPROFILE%\\.foundry_local_playground\\local-playground.sqlite`
- Saved MCP profiles are selectable in `MCP Servers` tab and can be connected directly to the current thread.
- Adding a new MCP server should:
  - validate inputs by transport
  - save/update profile in DB
  - connect the resulting server to the active thread
- Detect duplicate configurations when saving:
  - reuse existing config
  - emit warning
  - allow rename behavior when incoming name differs
- For HTTP MCP:
  - always include `Content-Type: application/json`
  - allow additional custom headers
  - support per-server timeout and per-server Azure token scope
  - when Azure auth is enabled, inject `Authorization: Bearer <token>` at request time from `DefaultAzureCredential`
- Share MCP input validation between frontend and backend via `app/lib/mcp/validation.ts`; UI and route parsers may format context-specific error messages but should not duplicate validation rules.
- Share MCP server config parsing across chat and MCP routes via `app/lib/mcp/server-config-parser.ts`; keep context-specific error prefixes/messages at the call site, not duplicated parser logic.
- For MCP session pool contention, prefer bounded wait-and-reuse before ephemeral fallback to improve session reuse and reduce connection churn.
- Register runtime shutdown cleanup hooks once (idempotent) and close all Thread MCP sessions during process shutdown.
- For session pool idle cleanup, close MCP sessions with best-effort safe close and warning logs so close failures never surface as unhandled rejections.

## MCP Debugging UX

- Keep MCP visibility high; this app is an MCP debugging workbench.
- During local development, the web server `/mcp/debug` endpoint hosts an MCP server and may be used for debugging, including inspecting all SQLite tables.
- Treat `/mcp/debug` database-table inspection as a development/debug workflow, not a production access pattern.
- Show MCP Operation Log inline in Playground per dialog turn.
- Do not render MCP log blocks when a turn has no MCP operations.
- Default MCP log panels to collapsed.
- Preserve request/response order and show JSON-RPC payloads.
- Show MCP communication logs on success and error paths.
- Provide copy actions for:
  - dialog content
  - whole MCP operation entry
  - request/response payload parts
- Use shared copy UI primitives for copy affordances to keep behavior and appearance consistent.

## Shared UI Primitives

- Reuse shared components in `app/components/home/shared/` instead of duplicating markup:
  - `ConfigSection` for section header/title/description shell
  - `StatusMessageList` for grouped status/error/success bars
  - `AutoDismissStatusMessageList` for timed dismissible status bars
  - `LabeledTooltip` for titled multiline tooltips
  - `CopyIconButton` for copy icon action buttons
- When adding new repeated UI patterns, extract to `shared` first if used in 2+ places.

## Build / Release

- Release trigger is tag push: `v*.*.*`.
- GitHub Actions should build OS installers and attach them to GitHub Release assets:
  - macOS (`.dmg`, `.zip`)
  - Windows (`.exe` via NSIS)
- Keep local packaging scripts aligned with workflow (`desktop:package*`).

## Documentation

- Keep `README.md` aligned with implemented behavior and script names.
- Keep screenshot assets in `docs/images/` current with the latest UI.
- When layout/UX changes are introduced, refresh screenshot files referenced by README.
- Prefer screenshots that show realistic usage value (meaningful prompt/response and relevant panel state), not empty UI.

## Quality Gates

- After UI/API changes, run:
  - `npm run quality:gate`
  - (`quality:gate` runs `npm audit --omit=dev`, `npm run prisma:generate`, `npm run typecheck:core`, `npm run test:core`, `npm run build:core`)
- After refactors, remove dead code:
  - unused components/files
  - unused CSS selectors in `app/app.css`
  - stale/obsolete tests or old-name references
